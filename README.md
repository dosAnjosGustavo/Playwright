# Playwright: QA Fundamentals Practice

Welcome to my **Playwright** repository! This project was created to practice core QA activities and hands-on test automation using the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework. My goal is to build real-world end-to-end tests by exploring the [Ecommerce Playground](https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/) website, ensuring a deep understanding of how to plan, write, and execute effective automated tests.

## Objectives

- **Learn Playwright**: Get comfortable with Playwrightâ€™s setup, configuration, and browser automation features.
- **QA Fundamentals**: Apply test design, coverage strategies, and best practices in a realistic scenario.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Gradually expand the test suite, refine test code, and integrate additional QA tools as needed.

## Features to Explore

- **User Flows**: Log in, sign up, add items to cart, and proceed through checkout.
- **UI Interactions**: Validate page elements, navigation, and user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Test edge cases and negative scenarios to ensure resilience.
- **Reporting & Analysis**: Generate test reports, collect logs, and troubleshoot failed cases.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dosAnjosGustavo/Playwright.git

   ```

2. Install Dependencies

   ```bash
   cd playwright
   npm install

   ```

3. Execute Tests
   npx playwright test

4. View Results

- Check the console output or open the Playwright report (if configured) for detailed results.

## Future Plans

- CI/CD Integration: Configure GitHub Actions or another CI tool to run tests automatically on each commit or pull request.
- Advanced Scenarios: Incorporate performance, accessibility, or API testing in conjunction with Playwright.
- Documentation: Provide detailed guides on testing strategies, environment setup, and best practices.
